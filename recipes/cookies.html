    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These brown butter pecan cookies are like a bigger, more caramelly version of Pecan Sandies. Browning the butter and toasting the pecans really intensifies the flavor in the best possible way.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pecans in a large, light-colored skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly until pecans are toasted, about 5 minutes. Pour pecans into a small bowl and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel. Add butter to the skillet, and place it back over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until butter begins to brown and smell nutty, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour browned butter into a large mixing bowl and allow to cool for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Add brown sugar and white sugar to the mixing bowl with cooled browned butter; and mix until combined. Add in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Add in 1 1/4 cups flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and nutmeg and mix until just combined. Add in remaining 1 1/4 cups flour and mix until just combined. Stir in toasted pecans. Dough will be somewhat thick.</li>
        <li>Scoop out 3 tablespoons of dough and roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining dough. Place dough balls about 1 1/2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets, and flatten balls to about 1/2-inch thick with the bottom of a glass.</li>
    </ol>
